                <p>The brain is the central organ of the human nervous system, housed within the skull. It is
                    responsible for processing sensory information, regulating bodily functions, and enabling cognition
                    and behavior.</p>

                        <h4>Cerebrum</h4>
                        <p>The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain and is divided into left and right hemispheres.
                            It is responsible for higher brain functions such as thought and action.</p>

                        <h4>Cerebellum</h4>
                        <p>The cerebellum is located under the cerebrum and is involved in the coordination of voluntary
                            movements, balance, and posture.</p>

                            the body, including breathing and heart rate.</p>
